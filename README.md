This *.bash_aliases* file is a collection of *alias* commands for the *bash* shell.

This *.bash_aliases* file is a collection of *alias* commands for the *bash* 
shell. It has been compiled over a number of years, taking advice and ideas 
from numerous sources, both on- and offline, and from my own experiences. I 
have been using these aliases for almost as long as I have been using Unix 
and the inspiration for these commands is lost to the mists of time. Some 
aliases are wholly new commands. Some simply introduce sane defaults for 
dangerous commands (for example *rm*). Yet more aliases swap out some standard 
programs for better alternatives (for example using *less* instead of *more*).
